## Phase 1 — SSA Pilot (in progress)

- **Status**: 14 sub-slices shipped to `main` over a single intensive
  session (2026-05-05). Phase 1 ~85% by code volume; remaining work is
  Paystack billing test (D.2), Laravel ETL (D.3), and Process Map +
  Fishbone UI (A.5).
- **Branch model**: switched back to dev/PR flow in Slice D.4 (ADR 0006
  superseded). All future Phase 1 work goes through PR.

### Sub-slices shipped

| Slice | Commit | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| A.1 | `c71acda` | Trainer/sponsor/admin override of AI grading + audit-logged persistence + ADR 0009 (workspace routing decision) |
| A.2 | `a1e4ddb` | Generic AI grading abstraction (`GradingPrompt<TInput>` + prompt registry + `gradeTopic` runner) |
| A.3 | `aa53148` + `492e6ba` | 5-Whys topic kind + Charter promoted from read-only to editable + AI grading on both |
| A.4 | `9db5c87` | Long-form generic topic kind + full DMAIC template (Measure / Improve / Control / Exec topics) |
| B.1 | `636b81b` | Schema for workspace_invitations + classes + class_enrolments + RLS |
| B.2 | `636b81b` | Workspace member invite-by-email + Brevo template + accept-invite route + members page |
| B.3 | `0997676` | Classes UI — list, create, detail, roster, auto-spawn delegate projects |
| B.4 | `6b58c18` | Phase sign-off workflow — schema + server actions + sponsor email + delegate decision email + approvals queue |
| B.5 | `7613281` | CSV bulk delegate import (uses existing invite mechanism, parallel email send) |
| C.1 | `e755599` | Topic-level comments thread |
| C.2 | `3d98e31` | Histogram stat (V1 stats #2) |
| C.3 | `84e2aeb` | I-MR + X-bar / R control charts (V1 stats #3, #4) |
| C.4 | `0b7d014` | Capability + 1-sample t + 2-sample t — V1 stats allowlist complete (7/7) |
| C.5 | `53559c1` | Sponsor ROI dashboard with per-class roll-up + per-delegate phase chips |
| D.1 | `34bfab0` | Project completion → SSA-style PDF certificate via @react-pdf/renderer |
| D.4 | (this commit) | Reinstate dev/PR flow ahead of SSA pilot (ADR 0006 superseded) |

### Remaining Phase 1 work

- **D.2 Paystack billing test** — needs Paystack sandbox keys from 2KO.
- **D.3 Laravel → Postgres ETL** — needs the Laravel DB schema or sample
  export from 2KO.
- **A.5 Process Map + Fishbone** — UI work, ~half a day each. Not
  blocking SSA pilot.
- **D Polish** — phase-aware AI Copilot (currently per-topic only),
  in-app inbox notifications (currently email only), formal report
  exports (currently dashboards only). All optional-for-pilot.

### V1 success criteria status (master plan §3)

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | SSA using new platform live | ⬜ requires real-world deployment |
| 2 | Laravel app being sunset for new cohorts | ⬜ requires D.3 + cutover |
| 3 | At least one Green Belt cohort completed end-to-end | ⬜ requires real cohort |
| 4 | At least one ROI figure captured + shown to sponsor | 🟢 capability built; awaits real data |
| 5 | AI guidance on all topics + 50% delegate use | 🟢 capability built; awaits usage |
| 6 | 80% AI interactions no negative override | 🟢 capability built; awaits usage |
| 7 | At least 5 stats tools live | ✅ **7 live** |
| 8 | SSA admins can independently run a class end-to-end | ✅ all features built |
| 9 | No tenant-isolation incident — verified through RLS + audit | ✅ RLS tested, audit log live |

---

## Phase 0B — Product Proof

- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (2026-05-05). Verified end-to-end on
  production: ROI capture round-trip, AI grading, topic-graded email,
  admin app pages. Inngest endpoint live + signing key configured
  (after a re-redeploy with the env vars properly saved).
- **Branch**: `main`.
- **Commits**:
  - `3a0ea96` — Slice 1 — OpenAI SIPOC grading + display
  - `53096ee` — Slice 2 — Brevo welcome + topic-graded emails
  - `1aab0aa` — Slice 3 — ROI capture + dashboard widget
  - `0e61af6` — Slice 5 — admin app + audit log + bootstrap audit
  - `590cc28` — Slice 4 — Inngest async grading scaffold
  - `9a37543` — docs sync (interim)

### Phase Completion Report

What was built (vs master plan §15 deliverables):

- ✅ **SIPOC graded by AI Copilot** — `packages/ai/src/prompts/grading/sipoc.v1.ts`,
  OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` JSON-mode, grading persists to
  `topic_solutions.grading` (jsonb), renders inline on the project page
  with decision pill + score + per-column feedback.
- ✅ **Email notification on grading** — `@sigmafy/emails` Brevo
  adapter with React Email templates (`WelcomeEmail`,
  `TopicGradedEmail`). Welcome fires on first signup (idempotent),
  topic-graded fires after each grading.
- ✅ **ROI capture** — `RoiPanel` component on the project page,
  `saveProjectRoi` server action, ZAR-cents storage, dashboard
  shows aggregate workspace ROI + per-project badges.
- ✅ **Sponsor-visible ROI** — workspace dashboard displays the
  aggregate via `Intl.NumberFormat('en-ZA', ...)`. Sponsor role
  gating arrives in Phase 1.
- ✅ **2KO admin can view workspaces** — `apps/admin` with tenant
  list + workspace detail + audit log. Each cross-tenant view writes
  an `audit_log` row.
- 🟡 **2KO admin can impersonate with logging** — half-met. Slice 5
  ships the "view workspace as admin" surface (admin sees projects,
  members, recent topic submissions); true cross-domain impersonation
  (admin acts AS the user) is deferred to Phase 1 because of the
  JWT/cookie handoff complexity.
- ✅ **Inngest async grading job** — `/api/inngest` live;
  `gradeSipocFn` with 4 step.run units (load, grade, persist, email);
  `save-sipoc` dispatches the event when keys are configured, falls
  back to inline otherwise.
- 🟡 **Polished Apple-style UI for all 0A and 0B screens** — passable
  but not exhaustively polished. Existing UI uses `@sigmafy/ui`
  primitives + Sigmafy blue tokens. Polish pass rolled into Phase 1.
- ⚠️ **Real recorded session as proof artifact** — not produced; tied
  to staging-URL feedback session with SSA team in Phase 1 prep.

Checks run:
- `pnpm turbo run lint typecheck test build` → green on every commit
  (8/8 in the final run).
- Production verification: signup → bootstrap → SIPOC submit → AI
  grading → email arrival → ROI capture → dashboard widget → admin
  tenant list / workspace detail / audit log all confirmed by 2KO.

Direction shifts that landed during 0B:
- Branch flow: `main`-only while no live users (ADR 0006). **Reinstate
  dev/PR flow before Phase 1 launch.**
- AI provider default: OpenAI (ADR 0007).
- Email provider default: Brevo (ADR 0008).

Decisions made (during 0B):
- Grading prompts versioned per the never-edit-published rule; SIPOC
  v1 lives at `packages/ai/src/prompts/grading/sipoc.v1.ts`.
- `topic_solutions.grading` jsonb (nullable) added via migration
  `0002_phase_0b_grading_column.sql`.
- Admin auth via env-var allowlist (`SIGMAFY_ADMIN_EMAILS`) for 0B;
  Clerk org roles in Phase 1.
- Bootstrap path now writes a `bootstrap.create_workspace` audit-log
  row — closes the deferred 0A audit item.
- Inngest with graceful inline fallback when keys are missing — code
  works in dev / no-keys without code paths going dark.

Known issues / deferred items:
- True cross-domain admin impersonation (admin acts as user, not just
  views as admin) — needs JWT/cookie handoff design. Phase 1 prep.
- UI polish pass — existing UI is functional and on-brand but not
  exhaustively reviewed against `dev-portal.sigmafy.co`.
- AI override UX (trainer/sponsor manual override of AI feedback) —
  the topic-graded card has a "trainer override coming in Phase 1"
  caption; the actual override mechanism lands in Phase 1.
- Stale phase-0a development tenants (`acme`, `zeta`) and users in
  Neon. Clean up before SSA pilot.
- Vercel auto-deploy from GitHub App not wired — deploys remain
  CLI-driven.
- Single-branch deploy risk — every commit to `main` ships to
  production. Reinstate dev/PR flow before Phase 1.
- Pasted secrets to rotate after SSA pilot prep starts: OpenAI, Brevo,
  Neon (`neondb_owner`), Inngest signing key.

Recommended next phase: **Phase 1 — SSA Pilot** (master plan §16).

Why this phase should come next:
- 0A proved the architecture, 0B proved the product shape. The
  remaining gap to V1 success is making SSA's next live Green Belt
  cohort runnable end-to-end on the platform — a much bigger surface
  area than 0A/0B (full DMAIC topics, 5–8 stats tools, sponsor
  workflow, certificates, ROI dashboards, cohort scheduling, AI
  override, Laravel ETL, parallel run, cutover).
- Per master plan §16, target is 8–12 weeks. We should agree a
  Phase-1 slicing strategy with 2KO before implementation begins.

Required approval before continuing:
- 2KO signoff required: **yes** — Phase 0B acceptance + Phase 1 plan +
  decision on the dev/PR-flow reinstatement timing.

## Direction shift — 2026-05-05

- Branch model retired `dev`; all work goes to `main` while no live users.
  Reinstates before Phase 1 SSA pilot (ADR 0006).
- AI provider default: Anthropic Claude → OpenAI in `@sigmafy/ai` (ADR 0007).
- Email provider default: Resend → Brevo in `@sigmafy/emails` (ADR 0008).
- Master build plan updated in §6, §10, §11, §12, §15, §18; mirrored to
  `docs/master-build-plan.md`.

---

## Phase 0A — Architecture Proof

- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** — verified end-to-end on production URL
  https://web-seven-gold-84.vercel.app on 2026-05-05.
- **Branch**: `main`.
- **Commit(s)**: `5aa9a3b` (phase-0a code, originally `13ca4ab` on retired
  dev), `f8caf45` + `e211ed5` (direction shift to main-only / OpenAI / Brevo),
  `c74b7d0` (NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY rename), `c4fa495`
  (ClerkProvider moved inside `<body>` for React 19 hydration), `099fda6`
  (explicit path/routing on Clerk SignIn/SignUp), `8bb81dd` (middleware
  matcher literal — root cause of blank /sign-up page).

### Deliverables (verbatim from §14 of the master build plan)

- [x] User signs up — wired (Clerk components, middleware, bootstrap). **Live
      verification pending Clerk keys.**
- [x] Workspace is created and RLS-protected from row one — `bootstrapUserAndWorkspace`.
- [x] User is assigned a Green Belt project from the canonical template — starter
      project created on first login.
- [x] User opens Define phase — `/projects/[id]` phase nav.
- [x] User views one topic: Project Charter — `charter-topic.tsx`.
- [x] User submits a SIPOC solution — `sipoc-topic.tsx` + `save-sipoc` action.
- [x] SIPOC saves to the DB under RLS — verified by 4/4 RLS integration tests.
- [x] User runs one Pareto analysis through the stats gateway — `pareto-topic.tsx`
      + `run-pareto` action; verified by 2/2 gateway integration tests.

### Verification

- `pnpm turbo run lint typecheck test build` → 24/24 green.
- `packages/db` RLS integration → 4/4 pass on live Neon (fail-closed,
  per-tenant scoping, cross-tenant rejection, malformed UUID rejection).
- `packages/stats-gateway` Pareto integration → 2/2 pass against live
  Fly.io; log row written + RLS-isolated.

### Decisions made (during Phase 0A)

- Schema for the DMAIC slice landed in two migrations:
  `0000_phase_0a_init.sql` (tables) and `0001_phase_0a_rls.sql` (policies).
- `app_user` Postgres role created without BYPASSRLS; `neondb_owner` is the
  audited service-role bypass.
- `withWorkspace(db, ws, fn)` opens a tx, sets the GUC, runs the callback.
- Pareto chosen as the first allowlisted stats endpoint.

### Open questions to settle in Phase 0B

- Lock the role enum in `@sigmafy/auth/types.ts` once Clerk's organisation
  model is confirmed against the five Sigmafy roles in production signup.
- Decide subdomain vs path prefix for workspace routing — phase-0a uses
  path-style; revisit when adding `apps/admin` impersonation flow.

### Phase Completion Report

Phase completed: **Phase 0A — Architecture Proof**
Branch: `main`
Commit(s): `5aa9a3b`, `f8caf45`, `e211ed5`, `c74b7d0`, `c4fa495`, `099fda6`,
`8bb81dd` — all on `main`. Originally landed as `13ca4ab` on the retired
`dev` branch.

What was built:
- Real Postgres schema on Neon — workspaces, users, memberships, projects,
  project_templates, topic_solutions, stats_call_log, audit_log.
- `app_user` Postgres role (no BYPASSRLS) + `neondb_owner` audited service
  role. RLS policies on every tenant-owned table reading
  `current_setting('app.current_workspace', true)`. `withWorkspace()`
  is the only sanctioned data seam.
- Clerk auth wired with five Sigmafy roles modelled in `@sigmafy/auth`.
- `bootstrapUserAndWorkspace()` in `apps/web/lib/auth.ts` creates the
  Sigmafy user + personal workspace + owner membership + starter Green
  Belt project on first sign-in. Idempotent. Service-role usage justified
  (no workspace context exists yet at signup).
- `@sigmafy/stats-gateway` with Pareto allowlisted; type-system blocks
  calls to non-allowlisted endpoints. `createDbStatsLogger` persists every
  call into `stats_call_log` under workspace context.
- DMAIC UI: marketing landing → Clerk sign-up → /dashboard with project
  list → /projects/[id] with phase nav (D-M-A-I-C-Exec Summary) and three
  topic kinds wired (Charter view, SIPOC editor + save, Pareto form +
  gateway call + result table with cumulative %).

Direction shifts applied during this phase (2026-05-05):
- Branch flow: `dev` retired; main-only while no live users (ADR 0006).
  Reinstate before Phase 1 SSA pilot.
- AI provider: Anthropic Claude → OpenAI in `@sigmafy/ai` (ADR 0007).
  Adapter is signature-only in 0A; first real call lands in 0B.
- Email provider: Resend → Brevo in `@sigmafy/emails` (ADR 0008). React
  Email components retained.

Checks run:
- `pnpm turbo run lint typecheck test build` → 34/34 green.
- `packages/db` RLS integration tests → 4/4 pass on live Neon.
- `packages/stats-gateway` Pareto integration tests → 2/2 pass against
  live Fly.io.
- Production verification on https://web-seven-gold-84.vercel.app —
  signup, workspace bootstrap, dashboard, project, Charter, SIPOC,
  Pareto round-trip all green; rows verified in `topic_solutions` and
  `stats_call_log` under correct `workspace_id`.

Live verification artefacts (2026-05-05):
- User: `darren.smith.210193@gmail.com`, Sigmafy id `0d142d31…`.
- Workspace: slug `darren-smith-210193-0d142d`, id `4ece1461…`.
- SIPOC row: `topic_solutions` at `topic_path = define.charter.sipoc`,
  status `submitted`, content with 5-column object.
- Pareto row: `topic_solutions` at `topic_path = define.charter.pareto`,
  content includes input + result (total=25, sorted figure data,
  cumulative %).
- Stats call: `stats_call_log` entry endpoint=`pareto`, status=`ok`,
  latency=307ms.

Issues fixed during 0A close-out:
- Pre-existing `.env.example` used `CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` instead of
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` (Clerk's Next.js SDK requires the
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix). Fixed in `c74b7d0`.
- `<ClerkProvider>` was wrapping `<html>`; React 19 + Next.js 15 + Clerk
  v6/v7 require it INSIDE `<body>` to avoid hydration mismatch. Fixed in
  `c4fa495`.
- Catch-all sign-in/sign-up routes needed explicit `path`+`routing`
  props for Clerk to bind properly. Fixed in `099fda6`.
- **Root-cause of blank /sign-up page**: `middleware.ts` re-exported
  `config` from `@sigmafy/auth/middleware`. Next.js requires `config` to
  be a statically analyzable literal in `middleware.ts`. Re-exports get
  erased; the matcher was unset; the middleware ran on every path
  including `/_next/static/chunks/*`; Clerk's `protect-rewrite` 404'd
  every JS/CSS asset. Fixed in `8bb81dd` by defining `config` as a
  literal in `apps/web/middleware.ts`.
- Clerk dev instance had `auth_phone.required_for_sign_up=true` but
  Clerk's phone verification doesn't support South African numbers.
  Disabled via `clerk config patch` (Clerk dashboard, not in repo).

Known issues / deferred items:
- `audit_log` table is empty even though `bootstrapUserAndWorkspace`
  uses service-role bypass. ADR 0003 calls for service-role usage to be
  audited. Phase 0B should write an audit entry for each
  service-role-protected operation (workspace creation, admin
  impersonation).
- Two stale workspaces (`acme`, `zeta`) and users from phase-0a
  development tests linger in the DB. Harmless. Clean up before SSA
  pilot.
- Vercel auto-deploy from GitHub isn't wired through the GitHub App;
  current deploys are CLI-driven (`vercel deploy --prod`). The
  auto-created `sigmafynew` Vercel project picks up pushes to main but
  has wrong settings. Connect `sigmafy-web` and `sigmafy-admin` to the
  GitHub App in Vercel before Phase 0B to remove the manual step.
- `STATS_API_SIGNING_SECRET` is documented but not yet enforced; the
  stats gateway accepts unsigned calls. Fine for V1's threat model
  (stats endpoint is read-only Pareto), but harden before exposing more
  endpoints in Phase 1.
- One-time chore: rotate the OpenAI, Brevo, and Neon credentials that
  were pasted in chat during this session.

Recommended next phase: **Phase 0B — Product Proof**

Why this phase should come next:
- Phase 0A proves the architecture works (RLS, gateway, auth, Clerk,
  Vercel, Neon all wired). It does NOT yet add product value the user
  can demo to SSA: there is no AI grading, no ROI capture, no email
  notification, no admin app. Phase 0B adds exactly those.
- Master plan §15 deliverable for 0B: SIPOC graded by AI Copilot via
  OpenAI; user receives Brevo email when grading completes; user enters
  estimated ROI; sponsor-visible ROI on workspace dashboard; 2KO admin
  can view + impersonate workspaces with audit logging.
- Done means SSA team can use the staging URL and give meaningful
  feedback. That unlocks Phase 1 (SSA pilot).

Required approval before continuing:
- 2KO signoff required: **yes** — confirm Phase 0A acceptance and
  approve Phase 0B kickoff before implementation begins.

## Phase -1 — Empty Repo Bootstrap

- **Date completed**: 2026-05-04
- **Branch**: `dev` (retired 2026-05-05)
- **Commit(s)**: `cf58fc9` (bootstrap), `0bfe5f9` (Vercel deploys wired).

### Deliverables (verbatim from §13 of the master build plan)

- [x] **Git baseline** — `dev` branch created and active during Phase -1.
- [x] **Monorepo tooling** — pnpm workspace, Turborepo, root `package.json`,
      lint, format, TypeScript, test config.
- [x] **Apps scaffold** — `apps/web` and `apps/admin` as Next.js 15 App Router
      apps; `apps/stats-api` placeholder.
- [x] **Packages scaffold** — `ui`, `auth`, `db`, `billing`, `stats-client`,
      `stats-gateway`, `ai`, `emails`, `config`.
- [x] **Vercel readiness** — `vercel.json` + verbatim project setup steps in
      `docs/environment-setup.md`.
- [x] **Environment docs** — `docs/environment-setup.md` with full env var
      table + first-time setup walkthrough.
- [x] **Build state docs** — `docs/build-state.md`, `docs/phase-log.md`,
      `docs/architecture-decisions.md` + 5 ADRs.
- [x] **Design baseline** — `packages/ui` tokens (Sigmafy blue + neutral ramp)
      and four primitives (Button, Input, Label, Card).
- [x] **CI baseline** — `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs lint, typecheck, test,
      build on PRs and pushes (since updated to `main`-only).

### Decisions made

- ADR 0001 — Monorepo layout (pnpm + Turborepo).
- ADR 0002 — UI source-of-truth (shadcn-into-`packages/ui`).
- ADR 0003 — RLS from day one (`withWorkspace` is the only sanctioned read/write seam).
- ADR 0004 — Billing abstraction (Paystack-first behind a provider interface).
- ADR 0005 — Stats gateway pattern (allowlist + signed call + audit log).
